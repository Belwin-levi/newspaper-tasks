                <h4><b>Here's How Sachin Tendulkar Came To Be Known As The Master Blaster</b></h4>    
                <p>The name Master Blaster has been associated with Sachin since we can remember. But the question we do tend to ask is how did it come in the first place? Well, truth be told, no one person actually gave this name. As the 1990s drew to a close, the name of Little Master began to get replaced with Master Blaster.</p>

                        <p>Love him or hate him, most have to concede there's never been an artist quite like Eminem, at least in the music world.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-4 "> 
                        <p>What often gets lost about one of the greatest albums of all time, is that it knows morality. It knows when it’s being bad, of course, but also how to be good. Whether Eminem is belatedly writing back his deranged and deceased fan with decent mental health advice on “Stan,” or expressing concern about the kids cheering for a violent movie on “Who Knew,” he is constantly questioning the war between art and life. He never stops fighting for art, but he knows a bit about life, too. “There’s a little Slim Shady in all of us,” is one of his healthiest admissions.</p>
